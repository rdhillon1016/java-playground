# Project Configuration

The `.idea` directory contains configuration files for your project. They contain information core to the project itself, such as names and locations of its component modules, compiler settings, etc.

# Running

You can pass arguments to your application by creating a **Run Configuration**.

# Project Bootstrapping

You can create a bootstrapped project with the IntelliJ project model, Maven, or Gradle.

A Maven bootstrapped project creates a `pom.xml` file and `src/main/java`, `src/main/resources` and `src/test/java` directories, as required by Maven.
